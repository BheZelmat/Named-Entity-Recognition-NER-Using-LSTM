# Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-Using-LSTM
This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of building a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project aims to identify and classify named entities such as people, locations, and organizations within text data, leveraging the power of LSTMs to understand and extract meaningful information from sequences.
